````
The king, who is free from diseases, shall act up to this ordinance; but when indisposed, he shall entrust all this to his servants.—(226)
````
Desirous of investigating cases, the king shall enter the court, with a dignified demeanour, along with Brāhmaṇas and councillors, versed in counsel.—(1)
````
There, either seated or standing, raising his right hand, subdued in dress and ornaments, he shall look into the suits of the suitors.—(2)
````
[He shall look into the suits]—day after day, one by one,—falling as they do under eighteen heads,—according to principles deduced from local usage and from the scriptures.—(3)
````
Of these the first is (1) Non-payment of Debt; (then) (2) Deposits, (3) Selling without ownership, (4) Joint concerns, (5) Non-delivery of what has been given away,—[4]—(6) Non-payment of wages, (7) Breach of Contract, (8) Recision of Sale and Purchase, (9) Dispute between the Owner and the Keeper,—[5]—(10) Disputes regarding Boundaries, (11) and (12) Assault, physical and verbal, (13) Theft, (14) Violence, (15) Adultery,—[6]—(16) Duties of man and wife, (17) Partition, and (18) Gambling and Betting;—these are the eighteen topics that form the basis of law-suits.—(4-7)
````
Taking his stand upon eternal morality, he shall form his decision on the suits of men who mostly carry on disputes in regard to the aforesaid points.—(8)
````
When he himself may not carry on the investigation of suits, he shall appoint a learned Brāhmaṇa to do the work of investigation.—(9)
````
That man, accompanied by three assessors, shall enter the excellent Court, and either seated or standing, shall investigate the suits on behalf of the king.—(10)
````
That place, where three Brāhmaṇas learned in the Veda sit, as also the learned Brāhmaṇa appointed by the king,—they regard as the ‘Court of Brahman.’—(11)
````
In a court where Justice is pierced by Injustice, and the members of the Court do not remove that dart, these members also become pierced.—(12)
````
One should either not enter the Court at all, or he should speak out what is equitable; one who either spe aks nothing, or speaks falsely, becomes tainted with sin.—(13)
````
Where justice is destroyed by injustice, or truth by falsehood, while people are looking on,—there the members of the court also are destroyed.—(14)
````
Justice, blighted, blights; and justice, preserved, preserves; hence justice should not be blighted, lest blighted justice blight us.—(15)
````
For Justice is the revered ‘Vṛṣa,’ Bull; and he who commits the violation, ‘alam,’ of it, him the gods regard as ‘vṛṣala,’ low-born; hence one shall not violate Justice.—(16)
````
Morality (Justice) is the only friend who follows one even after death; everything else perishes along with the body.—(17)
````
One quarter of the Injustice falls on the man who commits it, one quarter on the witness, one quarter on the members of the Court and one quarter on the king.—(18)
````
Where, however, the person deserving of censure is actually censured, there the king becomes sinless, the members of the court become freed, and the sin falls upon the perpetrator.—(19)
````
Even a so-called Brāhmaṇa, who makes a living by his caste only, may, at pleasure be the propounder of the Law for the king,—but not a Śūdra under any circumtsances.—(20)
````
The kingdom or that king for whom the investigation of Law is done by a Śūdra, while he himself is looking on, suffers, like the cow in a morass.—(21)
````
That kingdom where there is a majority of Śūdras, which is infested with non-believers and destitute of twice-born people, quickly perishes entirely, becoming afflicted by famine and disease.—(22)
````
Having occupied the Judgment-seat, with his body covered and mind collected, he shall salute the Guardian-Deities, and then proceed with the investigation of suits.—(23)
````
Understanding both ‘desirable’ and ‘undesirable’ to be only ‘Justice’ and ‘Injustice,’ he shall look into all the suits of the suitors, according to the order of the castes.—(24)
````
He shall discover the internal disposition of men by external signs: by variations in their voice, colour and aspect, as also by means of the eye and by gestures.—(25)
````
The inner mind is indicated by such variations as those of aspect, gait, gesture, speech, and by changes in the eye and the face.—(26)
````
The king shall take care of the property owned by a minor, till such time as he may return from the teacher’s house, or till he may have passed his minority.—(27)
````
There shall be similar protection in the case of barren women, of son-less women, of women devoted to their husbands, and of widows faithful to their husbands,—when their family is extinct, and when they are in distress.—(28)
````
While these women are alive, if their relatives should appropriate their property,—on them the righteous king shall inflict the punishment of thieves.—(29)
````
Property, the owner whereof has disappeared, the King shall keep for three years; up to three years the owner may receive it; but after that the King (shall take it).—(30)
````
He who says ‘this is mine’ should be questioned in proper form; and the owner ought to receive the property after having correctly described the colour, the number and other details regarding it.—(31)
````
If he does not provide a correct account of the place and time, and also the colour, form and size of the lost article, he deserves a fine equal to that article.—(32)
````
Property that has been lost and found should remain in the charge of specially deputed (officials); and the thieves that he may detect in connection with this, the king shall cause to be killed by an elephant.—(33)
````
Out of the property that has been lost and found, the king, remembering the duty of good men, shall take the sixth part, or the tenth, or the twelfth.—(34)
````
In regard to a treasure-trove, if a man says truly ‘this is mine,’—from him the king shall take the sixth part, or only the twelfth part.—(35)
````
But he who speaks falsely shall, be fined the eighth part of his property, or a smaller fraction, on calculation, of that same treasure-trove.—(36)
````
A learned Brāhmaṇa, having found treasure buried by his forefathers, shall take it wholly; as he is the master of everything.—(37)
````
When the king himself finds a hoard buried of old under the ground, he shall give one-half of it to the Brāhmaṇas and have the other half put in his treasury.—(38)
````
Of ancient hoards, as also of minerals under the ground, the king is entitled to his share, by reason of his protecting them,—he being the lord of the soil.—(39)
````
Property stolen by thieves should be restored by the king to men of all castes; by retaining such property, the king imbibes the sin of the thief.—(40)
````
The king knowing his duty shall determine the law for each man, after haying duly examined the provincial laws pertaining to each caste, the law’s of guilds, as also the laws of families.—(11)
````
For men following their respective occupations,—even though living at a distance,—come to be liked by the people, while they remain firm in their own duties.—(42)
````
Neither the king himself nor any servant of his shall promote a suit; nor shall he suppress a suit that has been brought up by another person.—(43)
````
Just as the hunter discovers the foot-print of the deer by the drops of blood, so should the king discover the right by means of inference.—(11)
````
When engaged in judicial proceedings, the king shall keep his eye upon the truth, upon the object, upon himself, the witness and upon the place, the time and the aspect.—(45)
````
What may be found to have been observed in practice by the good and the righteous twice-born men, that he shall ordain for countries, families and castes,—provided that it is not antagonistic.—(46)
````
On being prayed by the creditor for the recovery of money from the debtor, he shall make the debtor pay to the creditor the money proved to be due.—(47)
````Having determined the means by which the debtor may be able to get his money, he shall, by those same means, make the debtor pay up.—(48)
````
He shall make the advanced money repaid by means of good faith, tactful transaction, trick, moral pressure, and force, the fifth.—(49)
````
The creditor who shall himself recover his money from the debtor should not be prosecuted by the king, for recovering what is his own property.—(50)
````
The man who denies a debt shall be made to pay the creditor’s due, proved by evidence, as also a small fine, according to his means.—(51)
````
On denial by the debtor, when asked in court to pay the debt, the complainant shall produce a witness, or adduce (other) evidence.—(52)
````
He who mentions the wrong place,—or who, having mentioned it, retracts,—or who does not understand that his previous and subsequent statements are contradictory;—(53)
````
He who, having put forward a statement, subsequently retracts; and who on being questioned regarding a fact (previously) duly alleged, does not support it;—(54)
````
He who secretly converses with the witnesses in a place not fit for conversation, or who does not like the question being investigated, or who falls back;—(55)
````
—He who, on being ordered to speak, does not speak; or who does not prove what he has asserted;—or who does not grasp the previous and subsequent statements;—such a person fails in that suit.—(50)
````
Having asserted that he has witnesses, and on being asked to name them, if he does not name them,—him also, on these grounds, the judge shall declare to have failed in his suit.—(57)
````
If the complainant does not speak out, he shall be imprisoned and pined, according to law. If the other party does not answer within three fortnights, he becomes defeated according to law.—(58)
````
If one falsely denies a debt, or if the other falsely demands it,—these two, proficient in dishonesty, should be made by the king to pay a fine double that sum.—(59)
````
On having been summoned and questioned, if one denies it,—then he siiall be convicted by the man seeking for his due by means of at least three witnesses, in the presence of the king and the brāhmaṇas.—(60)
````
I shall declare now what sort of persons should be made witnesses in suits by wealthy men, and how the truth should be told by them.—(61)
````
Householders, men with sons, respectable natives, and men of the kṣatriya, vaiśya and śūdra castes are competent to act as witnesses, when cited by suitors;—and not any and every person, except in emergencies.—(62)
````
In all law-suits trustworthy men of all the castes, fully conversant with morality and free from avarice, should be made witnesses; the reverse of these should be avoided.—(63)
````
Neither interested persons, nor relations, nor helpers, nor enemies, nor persons of proved corruption, nor those afflicted with disease, nor the corrupted should be made witnesses.—(64)
````
The king should not be made a witness; nor craftsmen, nor actors, nor a Vedic scholar, nor one in holy orders, nor one who has renounced all attachments.—(65)
````
—Not one wholly dependent, nor one under pupilage, nor a paid servant, nor one who adopts forbidden occupations, nor one too old, nor a minor, nor a single person, nor one belonging to the lowest class, nor one with defective organs;—(66)
````
—Nor one afflicted, nor one intoxicated, nor one demented, nor one tormented by hunger and thirst, nor one oppressed by fatigue, nor one tormented by love, nor one who is in a rage, nor a thief.—(67)
````
—Woman should give evidence for women; and for twice-born persons similar twice-born men, virtuous śūdhas for śūdras, and men of the lowest caste for the lowest men.—(68)
````
In the case of anything done in the interior of a house, or in a forest, or in the case of injury to the body,—any person who may be cognisant of the facts may give evidence on behalf of the parties to the suit.—(69)
````
In the event of (proper witnesses) not forthcoming, evidence may be given by a woman, by a minor, by an aged person, by a pupil, by a relative, by a slave, or by a servant.—(70)
````
In the event of minors, aged and diseased persons deposing falsely in their evidence, the Judge should make up his mind regarding the speech being irregular; so also in the case of men with disordered minds.—(71)
````
In all cases of violence, of theft and adultery, and of assault, verbal and corporeal,—he shall not investigate the character of the witnesses.—(72)
````
On a conflict among witnesses, the king shall accept the majority; in the case of equality (of number) those possessed of superior qualifications; and in the case of conflict between equally qualified witnesses, the best among the twice-born.—(73)
````
Evidence based upon what is directly seen and is heard is admissible; and a witness, telling the truth in such cases, does not fall off from spiritual merit or worldly prosperity.—(74)
````
A witness asserting, in an assembly of noble men, anything apart from what he has seen and heard, falls downwards into hell after death and becomes shut out from heaven.—(75)
````
Even though not put down as a witness, if a person happens to see or hear anything in regard to a case,—when he comes to be questioned about it, he should speak out exactly as he has seen or heard it.—(76)
````
A single man, free from covetousness, may be a witness, but not many women, even though pure,—because the understanding of women is not steady,—nor other men who are tainted with defects.—(77)
````
What the witnesses state naturally, in relation to the case, should be accepted; apart from this what they state from considerations of righteousness, is useless.—(78)
````
The investigating Judge shall question the witnesses assembled in the court, in the presence of the plaintiff and the defendant, gently exhorting them in the following manner.—(79)
````
‘What you know of the mutual transaction between these two persons regarding this suit,—all that may you declare freely; since you are witnesses in this matter.’—(80)
````
‘The witness, telling the truth in his evidence, attains irreproachable regions, also unsurpassable fame; such speech is honoured by Brahmā himself.—(81)’
````
‘Stating the untruth in his evidence, he becomes firmly bound in Varuṇa’s fetters, helpless during a hundred births. One should, therefore, give true evidence.’—(82)
````
‘By truth is the witness purified, by truth does merit grow: hence the truth should be spoken by witnesses of all castes.’—(83)
````
‘The soul itself is the soul’s witness, and the soul itself is the soul’s refuge; disregard not your soul, the best witness of man.’—(84)
````
‘The sinners indeed think that “no one sees us”; but the gods see them, as also their own inner personality.’—(85)
````
‘Heaven, earth, water, heart, moon, sun, fire, death-god, wind, night, the two twilights, and morality know the conduct of all corporeal beings.’—(86)
````
In the presence of gods and Brāhmaṇas, during forenoon, the judge, pure himself, shall ask the twice-born persons, who have been purified and are facing either the north or the east, to give evidence.—(87)
````
He shall question the Brāhmaṇa with the word ‘speak,’ the Kṣatriya with ‘speak out the truth,’ the Vaiśya by sins pertaining to kine, grain and food, and the Śūdra by all the sins.—(88)
````
‘Whatever regions have been assigned to the slayer of the Brāhmaṇa, to the murderer of women and children, to the betrayer of friends and to the ingrate,—those same shall be thine if thou speakest falsely.’—(89)
````
‘Whatever merit, good man, you may have acquired since your birth, would go to the dogs, if you speak falsely.’—(90)
````
‘You think yourself, blessed man, that “I am alone”; but there ever sits in your heart the silent watcher of virtue and vice.’—(91)
````
‘The, god Yama, the son of Vivasvat, who sits in your heart,—if you have no quarrel with him, you need not visit the Gaṅgā, nor the Kurus.—(92)
````
‘He who gives false evidence shall go for alms, with a potsherd, to the house of his enemy,—naked and shorn, tormented with hunger and thirst, and blind.’—(93)
````
‘Headlong, in blind darkness shall the sinner fall into hell, who, on being interrogated in the course of a judicial investigation, answers the question falsely.—(94)
````
‘He who, having entered the court, bears testimony to what is contrary to facts and what he has not seen, swallows fish along with the bones,—just like a blind man.’—(95)
````
‘The gods do not regard any person in this world as superior to him, whom his knowing soul does not distrust, while he is speaking.’—(96)
````
‘Listen now, gentle friend, in due order, how many relatives, by number, one destroys by giving false evidence, in what cases.’—(97)
````
‘He destroys five by false evidence regarding animals; he destroys ten by false evidence regarding kine; he destroys a hundred by false evidence regarding horses, and a thousand by false evidence regarding men.’—(98)
````
‘Deposing falsely in regard to gold, he kills the born as well as the unborn; by false evidence regarding land, he kills all; never tell a lie regarding land.’—(99)
````
‘That concerning water they declare to be similar to that concerning land; as also that relating to the sexual enjoyment of women, and to gems, water-born as well as granitic.’—(100)
````
‘Having noticed all these evils proceeding prom perjury, speak out directly everything exactly what you have seen and heard.’—(101)
````
‘He shall treat like Śūdras the Brāhmaṇas who tend cattle, who engage in trade, and who are craftsmen, actors, menial servants ok money-lenders.’—(102)
````
In some cases, a man who, though knowing the truth, deposes otherwise, through piety, does not fall off from heaven. This is a divine assertion that they reproduce.—(103)
````
Where the telling of the truth would lead to the death of a Śūdra, a Vaiśva, a Kṣatriya or a Brāhmaṇa,—in that case falsehood should be spoken; as that is preferable to truth.—(104)
````
They should offer sacrifices to Sarasvati with half-boiled rice dedicated to the speech-goddess,—doing the best expiation for the sin of untruthfulness.—(105)
````
Or he shall offer according to rule, clarified butter into the fire, with the ‘kuṣmāṇḍa’-texts or with the verse ‘ut, etc.’ sacred to varuṇa, or with the three verses sacred to the waters.—(106)
````
The man, who, without being ill, does not give evidence for three fortnights, in regard to debts and other matters, should hear that entire debt, as also a penalty of the tenth part in all cases.—(107)
````
That witness,—who may be found, within a week of having given evidence, to suffer from sickness, fire or the death of a relative,—should be made to pay the debt and also the penalty.—(108)
````
In witness-less cases, if he cannot get at the truth between the two disputants by any means, he should discover it by means of oath.—(109)
````
By the great sages, as well as by the Gods, oaths have been taken for the purposes of a case; Vasiṣṭha even swore an oath before the King Paijavana.—(110)
````
The wise man shall not take an oath improperly; taking an improper oath, one becomes ruined here as well as after death.—(111)
````
There is no serious offence in swearing to women, or in connection with marriages, fodder for cows, or fuel, or for the sake of a Brāhmaṇa.—(112)
````
The Brāhmaṇa should be made to swear by truth, the Kṣatriya by conveyances and weapons, the Vaiśya by cattle, grains and gold, and the Śūdra by all sins.—(113)
````
Or, he may make him fetch fire, or make him dive under water, or make him touch the heads of his son and wife severally.—(114)
````
He whom the blazing fire burns not, or whom the water does not throw up, or who does not speedily suffer some misfortune, should be regarded as pure on his oath.—(115)
````
Formerly when Vatsa was accused by his younger brother, fire, the world’s spy, did not burn even a hair of his, because of truth.—(116)
````
In whatever suit false evidence should have been given, the effect of that shall cease, and what has been done shall be undone.—(117)
````
Evidence is called ‘false,’ when it is due to greed, or embarrassment, or fright, or friendship, or lust, or anger, or ignorance, ok childishness.—(118)
````
I am going to explain, in due order, the particular punishments for him who should give false evidence from any one of these causes.—(119)
````
If through greed, he should be fined a thousand; if through embarrassment, the lowest amercement; if through fear, two middlling ones; if through friendship, four times the first.—(120)
````
If through lust, ten times the first; if through anger, three times the next; if through ignorance, full two hundred; and if through childishness, only a hundred.—(121)
````
They declare these penalties for false evidence to have been prescribed by the wise, for the purpose that justice may not fail and injustice hay be prevented.—(122)
````
The king shall however fine and then banish the three castes giving false evidence; but the Brāhmaṇa he shall deprive of his clothes (and dwelling).—(123)
````
Manu Svāyambhuva has named ten places for punishment, where it should be inflicted in the case of the three castes; but the Brāhmaṇa shall depart unscathed.—(124)
````
(1) The genital organ, (2) the stomach, (3) the tongue, (4) the hands, (5) the feet, (6) the eye, (7) the nose, (8) the ears, (9) the property and (10) the body.—(125)
````
Having duly ascertained the motive and the time and place, and having taken into consideration the condition (of the accused) and the nature of the offence,—he shall inflict punishment upon those deserving punishment.—(126)
````
Unjust punishment is destructive of reputation among men and subversive of fame; in the other world also it leads to loss of heaven; he shall therefore avoid it.—(127)
````
The king, punishing those who do not deserve to be punished, and not punishing those who deserve to be punished, attains great ill-fame and goes to hell.—(128)
````
First of all, he shall inflict punishment in the form of reprimand, then in the form of reproach, thirdly in the form of fine, and after that the death-penalty.—(129)
````
When however he is not able to restrain them even by the ‘death-penalty,’—then he should inflict on them all these four.—(130)
````
I am going to describe fully, for the sake of business-transactions, those technical terms that are used in the world in connection with silver and gold.—(131)
````
The small mote that is seen when the sun shines through a lattice-hole they declare to be the ‘triad,’ the very first of measures.—(132)
````
Eight Triads should be known as one ‘Louse-egg’ in measure; three of these as one ‘Black Mustard’; and three of these latter as a ‘White Mustard.’—(133)
````Six ‘mustards’ make one middling ‘barley-corn’; three of these make one ‘guñjā-berry’; a ‘bean’ is made of five ‘guñja-berries;’ and sixteen ‘beans’ make one ‘gold-piece.’—(131)
````
Four ‘gold-pieces’ make one ‘pala,’ ten palas one ‘dharaṇa’; and two ‘guñja-berries’ of equal weight should be known as one ‘silver-bean.’—(135)
````
Sixteen of these latter make one ‘silver-dharaṇa’ or ‘purāṇa’; and a ‘karṣa’ of copper is to be known as ‘kārṣāpaṇa’ or ‘paṇa.’—(136)
````
Ten ‘dharaṇas’ are to be known as the ‘silver śatamāna’ (centimetre); and the ‘niṣka’ should be understood as four ‘gold-pieces’ in weight.—(137)
````
The first amercement has been declared to be two hundred and fifty paṇas; the middling is to be known as five hundred; and the highest as a thousand.—(138)
````
On the debt being admitted to be due, the debtor deserves (a fine of) five per cent.; and in the case of denial, twice as much; such is the ordinance of manu.—(139)
````
The money-lender shall stipulate an interest sanctioned by Vasiṣṭha, for increasing the capital. He shall take monthly the eightieth part of a hundred.—(140)
````
Or, remembering the duty of the righteous, he may take two in the hundred; by taking two per cent. he does not incur the sin of extortion.—(141)
````
He may charge just two, three, four or five per cent. per month from the four castes respectively.—(142)
````
But when there is profitable pledge, he shall receive no interest on the loan; and there shall be neither transference nor sale of the pledge, merely by the lapse of time.—(143)
````
The pledge shall not be used by force; using it thus, he shall renounce the interest; he shall satisfy the other party with its pr ice; otherwise he would be a stealer of the pledge.—(144)
````
Pledges and Deposits should not suffer much lapse of time; for being left over for a long time, they would be liable to appropriation.—(145)
````
Things used through favour are never forfeited; such as a milch cow, a camel, an ox or the animal that is made over for breaking in.—(146)
````
Whatever thing the owner meekly sees being used by others in his presence, for ten years,—that thing he does not deserve to recover.—(147)
````
If the owner is neither an idiot nor a minor, and the property is used in his own country,—it becomes frustrated in law, and the user becomes entitled to the property.—(148)
````
A pledge, a boundary, minor’s property, a deposit, a property enjoyed by favour, women, king’s property, and the property of a vedic scholar are not lost by adverse possession.—(149)
````
The fool, who, without the owner’s permission, uses a deposit, shall have to remit half the amount of the interest, as compensation for such use.—(150)
````
Interest on money-loans stipulated at one time shall not exceed the double; in the case of grains, fruits, wool and beasts of burden, it shall not go beyond the quintuple.—(151)
````
Interest, stipulated in contravention of the law, being excessive, is not payable. They declare this to be the usurer’s way. It is only five per cent. to which the man is entitled.—(152)
````
One shall not pay or receive an interest beyond the annual, or what is unapproved (or unaccumulated); nor compound interest, nor periodical interest, nor that which is (privately) stipulated, nor corporeal.—(153)
````
He who, unable to repay the debt, wishes to renew the contract, shall change the bond, after paying the accrued interest.—(154)
````
Not having brought forward the gold, he should renew the bond; and he should pay as much interest as may be possible.—(155)
````
When a man has entered into a ‘wheel-contract’ wtth reference to a particular place or time,—if he fails in regard to the place or time, he shall not suffer its reward.—(156)
````
As regards the exact amount to be paid, the interest shall be that which is fixed by persons expert in sea-voyages, and those capable of calculating the profits in connection with a particular place and time.—(157)
````
When a man stands surety for the appearance of a person, if he does not produce him, he shall pay his debt out of his own property.—(158)
````
But the son shall not be liable to pay the surety-money, or a futile gift, or gambling deists, or debts due to liquor, or the balance of fines and duties.—(159)
````
The law laid down in the preceding verse shall apply to the case of ‘Surety for appearance’; in the case of the death of the ‘Surety for payment’ however, the king shall make the heirs also to pay up.—(160)
````
“By what means then would the creditor seek to obtain his dues, in the event of the death of the surety other than that for ‘payment,’ whose character is fully known?”—(161)
````
If the surety were one to whom money had been made over and who had enough money,—then he to whom it had been made over shall pay it out ok his own property; such is the settled rule.—(162)
````
A transaction is not valid when effected by one who is drunk, or insane, or distressed, or wholly dependent, or minor, or senile, or unauthorised—(163)
````
No contract, even though substantiated, is valid, if what is contracted for is contrary to law or to established custom.—(161)
````
Fraudulent mortgages and sales, fraudelent gifts and acceptances, as also all wherein he detects fraud—he shall nullify.—(165)
````
When the borrower is lost, and the expenditure was incurred by the family, the debt is to be paid by the relatives out of their own property, even though these may have been separated.—(166)
````
Should even a servant effect a transaction for the sake of the family,—the master, whether in his own country or abroad, should not repudiate it.—(167)
````
What is given by force, what is ennjoyed by force, what has been caused to be written by force,—all thansactions effected by force Manu has declared to be void.—(168)
````
Three persons suffer for the sake of others: witnesses, surety and the judge: while four persons prosper: the brāhmaṇa, the affluent, the merchant and the king.—(169)
````
Even though reduced (in circumstances), the King shall not take what ought not to be taken; and even though affluent, he shall not relinquish what ought to be taken, be it ever so small.—(170)
````
By the taking of what he ought not to take and by the relinquishing of what he ought to take the king’s weakness becomes proclaimed, and he becomes ruined here as also after death.—(171)
````
By taking what is his due, by the proper adjustment of castes, and by protecting the weak, the power of the king grows, and he prospers here as also after death.—(172)
````
For these reasons, the King shall, like Yama, renounce his likes and dislikes, and behave in the manner of Yama,—his anger suppressed and his senses controlled.—(173)
````
If an evil-minded king, through folly, deal with cases unjustly,—his enemies bring him under their control in no time.—(174)
````
When however, having subdued love and hatred, he deals with cases justly, his subjects turn towards him, as the rivers towards the ocean,—(175)
````
A person who complains to the king against the creditor trying to accomplish his purpose by his own will,—should be made by the king to pay the fourth part, and also the total amount to him—(176)
````
Even by labour shall the debtor make good what is due to the creditor, if he is of the same or of a lower caste; the superior person shall pay it up gradually.—(177)
````
In this manner shall the king settle the disputes of men quarrelling among themselves, deciding them with the help of witnesses and other evidence.—(178)
````
The wise man shall, entrust a deposit to one who is born of good family, is endowed with character, cognisant of the law, and truthful, has a large following, and is wealthy and honourable—(179)
````
In the form in which one shall deposit a thing in the hands of another person, in that same form shall that thing be received back; as the delivery so the recovery.—(180)
````
When requested to restore the deposit, if the trustee do not restore it to the depositor,—then, on the departure of that depositor, in the event of there being no witnesses, the judge shall actually deposit gold (with the trustee) through spies of proper age and appearance, under some pretexts, and then ask him to restore it.—(181-182)
````
If he admits the deposit exactly in the form and shape in which it was entrusted,—then there is nothing in the charge brought against him by others.—(183)
````
If, however, he should not restore that gold to them in the proper manner, he should be forced to restore both; such is the decree of the law.—(184)
````
Deposits, open and sealed, should never be handed over to the next-of-kin; in the event of a mishap occurring, they become lost; though they do not become lost, if no mishap occurs.—(185)
````
If the man restores it himself to the next-of-kin of the deceased depositor,—he should not be harassed by the king, or by the depositor’s relatives.—(186)
````
In doubtful cases he should try to obtain it without artifice and in a friendly manner; or having ascertained his character, he should settle the matter by gentle means.—(187)
````
In the case of all deposits, such should be the method of restoration; but in the case of a sealed deposit, he should incur nothing, if he does not extract anything from it.—(188)
````
The depositary shall not hake good what has been stolen by thieves, or carried away by water, or burnt,—if he does not extract anything from it.—(189)
````
The appropriator of a deposit, as also one who has not deposited anything (and yet asks for it),—the king shall test by all methods, as also by means of oaths and ordeals prescribed in the scriptures.—(190)
````
He who does not restore a deposit, and he who, without having made any deposit, asks for it,—both of these should be punished like thieves, or be made to pay a fine equal in value.—(191)
````
In all cases the king shall make the appropriator of a deposit pay a fine equal in value to it; also the appropriator of a friendly loan.—(192)
````
The man who may appropriate, by fraudulent means, the property of another person, should be punished publicly, along with his accomplices, with various modes of death.—(193)
````
As much of a certain deposit has been entrusted in the presence of a number of men—so much should it be decided to be; the party misrepresenting it becomes liable to punishment.—(194)
````
When a trust has been created privately and accepted also privately, then it should be restored also secretly: as the delivery so the restoration.—(195)
````
Thus shall the king come to a decision regarding property given as ‘deposit’ and that which is given as ‘friendly loan,’—without causing any injury to the keeper of the deposit.—(196)
````
Thus shall the king come to a decision regarding property given as ‘deposit’ and that which is given as ‘friendly loan,’—without causing any injury to the keeper of the deposit.—(196)
````
If a man sells another man’s property, without being its owner, and without the owner’s consent, the judge shall not admit him as a witness,—he being a thief; though he may not be regarded as a thief.—(197)
````
If a relative, he shall be made to pay the penalty of six hundred; if he is not a relative, nor one having access to him, he shall incur the guilt of theft (specially).—(198)
````
If a gift or sale is made by one who is not the owner, it should be held to be as not-made,—such being the rule of judicial proceedings.—(199)
````
Where possession is evident, but no sort of title is perceptible, there title, and not possession, shall be the proof; such is the settled rule.—(200)
````
If a man obtains a property from the market, in the presence of witnesses, he acquires that property with a clear title obtained by legal purchase.—(201)
````
If the source cannot be traced, the person (buyer), whose conduct has been cleared by the fact of the sale being public, is let off without punishment, but the man who lost the property shall receive it back.—(202)
````
Any commodity that is mixed up with another should not be sold; nor what is without substance, nor what is deficient, nor what is at a distance, nor what is concealed.—(203).
````
After one damsel has been shown, if another be given to the bridegroom, then he should marry both of them for the same single price,—so Manu has ordained.—(204)
````
The giver, of a girl who is insane or leprous or has suffered copulation, does not deserve punishment, if he has previously declared her defects.—(205)
````
If a priest appointed at a sacrifice abandons his work, his associates shall pay him only such share as may be in keeping with the work actually done by him.—(206)
````
He who abandons his work after the fees have been paid, should receive his full share; and the work should be got done by another.—(207)
````
In connection with a rite, when specific fees are prescribed for its several parts,—will one man take all these, or shall they all share them?
````
At Fire-laying, the Adhvaryu shall take the chariot, and the Brahman the horse; or the Hotṛ shall take the house: and the Udgātṛ shall take the cart at the Soma-purchase.—(209)
````
From among all, the chief men shall receive half; the next shall receive half of that; the ‘thirders’ the third part and the ‘fourthers’ the fourth part of it.—(210)
````
Among men carrying on their business jointly, the allotment of shares should be done by the application of these principles.—(211)
````
When a man gives money, for a pious purpose, to another who asks for it,—if, subsequently, it is not used for that purpose, then, it shall not be given to him.—(212)
````
If, through arrogance or greed, the man should seek to recover it, he should be made by the King to pay one gold-piece, as an expiation for that theft.—(213)
````
Thus has been fully explained the lawful non-misappropriation of gifts; after this I am going to describe the ‘non-misappropriation of Wages.’—(214)
````
If a hireling, without being ill, does not perform the stipulated work, through arrogance,—he should be fined eight ‘Kṛṣṇalas,’ and should not receive his wages.—(215)
````
But if he is ill and on recovering, completes the work as originally stipulated, he shall receive his wages for it, even after a long time.—(216)
````
When a man, sick or well, does not get the stipulated work done, he shall not receive hi s wages,—even though the work be only slightly incomplete.—(217)
````
Thus has the entire law bearing upon the action of ‘Non-payment of Wages’ been explained. After this I am going to expound the law relating to Contract-breakers.—(218)
````
If a man, after having entered into a compact under oath with a village, a country or a confederation, should break it, through greed,—him the king shall banish from his kingdom.—(219)
````
Having caught such a breaker of compact, he shall make him pay six ‘niṣkas’ of four ‘suvarṇas’ each, and also one silver ‘śatamāna.’—(220)
````
This is the law of punishment which the king shall follow in the case of the breakers of compacts relating to villages and caste-federations.—(221)
````
If, after having bought or sold anything, one should repent of it, he may return or take back that thing within ten days.—(222)
````
But after ten days, he shall neither return nor take it back; he who takes it back, as well as he who returns it, should be fined by the king six hundred.—(223)
````
If a man gives a defective damsel, without mentioning the defects, he should be punished by the king himself with a fine of ninety-six ‘paṇas.’—(221)
````
If a man, through malice, speaks of a maiden as ‘not a virgin’ he should receive the punishment of one hundred, if unable to prove her impurity.—(225)
````
The marriage-ritual texts are applicable to virgins only, and nowhere among men, to non-virgins; and this because these latter are excluded from religious acts.—(220)
````
The marriage -texts are clearly conducive to ‘wife-hood’; and these are to be recognised by the learned as completed at the ‘seventh-step.’—(227)
````
Whenever any person should have repentance in regard to any compact that has been entered into—the king shall bring him to the righteous path, in the manner just described.—(228)
````
I am going to expound fully the true law relating to disputes between owners and keepers arising from transgressions regarding cattle.—(229)
````
Responsibility for the safe keeping during the day rests with the keeper, and during the night, with the owner, ip in his own house; if otherwise, the keeper should be responsible.—(230)
````
If the hired cattle-keeper is one paid with milk, he shall, with the owner’s permission, milk the best out of ten; this shall be the ‘wages’ of the keeper, if he receives no other wages.—(231)
````
The keeper alone should make good what has strayed, or been destroyed by worms, or killed by dogs, or has perished in an unsafe place,—if it was left without human aid.—(232)
````
But the keeper shall not have to make good what has been taken away by thieves openly,—if he informs his own master of it at the proper place and time.—(233)
````
On the death of the animals, he shall make over to the owner their ears, skin, tail-hairs, bladder and tendons and the concrete bile, and also point out their marks.—(231)
````
When goats and sheep have been surrounded by wolves, and the keeper does not come for ward,—if the wolf forcibly kill any, the blame shall lie with the keeper.—(235)
````
When however, they are grazing together in the forest, duly protected,—if a wolf pounces upon one and kills it,—the keeper is not to blame.—(236)
````
Around the village there should be a pasture-ground, four hundred ‘bows’ or three ‘stick-throws’ (in width); but three times that space around the town.—(237)
````
If the cattle damage the unfenced crops therein, the king, in that case, shall not inflict punishment on the cattle-keepers.—(238)
````
One should set up an enclosure there which the camel cannot see, and shut up every opening through which the head of a dog ok a boar could be thrust.—(239)
````
If cattle attended by the keeper be found in an enclosed field, on the road-side or near the village, the keeper should be fined a hundred; but cattle without a keeper shall be driven off.—(240)
````
In the case of other fields, the cattle-keeper should be fined a ‘paṇa’ and a quarter; and in all cases the crop shall be made good to the owner of the field; such is the established rule.—(241) 
````
But Manu has declared that no punishment shall be inflicted upon a cow within ten days of its calving, or bulls or dedicated cattle,—whether with or without keepers.—(242)
````
When there is transgression on the part of the farmer himself, his fine shall be ten times the royal share,—half of that in the case of servants, if it is unknown to the farmer.—(243)
````
This is the rule that the righteous king shall observe, in the case of transgressions by owners, by cattle and by the keepers.—(244)
````
When a dispute regarding boundaries arises between two villages, the king shall settle the boundary during the month of Jyeṣṭha, when the landmarks are distinctly perceptible.—(245)
````
He shall plant boundary-trees,—such as the Nyagrodha, the Aśvattha, the Kiṃśuka, the Śālmalī, the Sāla and the Tāla,—as also plants with milky juice.—(246)
````
Also thickets, bamboos of various kinds, the Śamī-tree, creepers and mounds, reeds and Kubjaka thickets; trees shall not be obliterated.—(247)
````
Tanks, water-reservoirs, ponds and fountains should be built on boundary-links; as also temples.—(248)
````
He shall also set up hidden boundary-marks,—seeing that in the world there are constant trespasses, due to the ignorance of boundaries among men.—(249) 
````
As also, stones, bones, cow’s hair, chaff, ashes, potsherds, dry cow dung, bricks, cinders, pebbles, and sand.—(250)
````
Other such-like things which the earth may not eat up in time,—these he shall secretly set up on junctions of boundaries.—(251)
````
By these signs shall the king determine the boundary between two contending parties; as also by long-continued possession and by flowing streams of water.—(252)
````
If, even on the inspection of the marks, there should be a doubt, the settlement of the dispute regarding boundaries shall be entirely dependent upon witnesses.—(253)
````
Witnesses regarding boundaries shall be questioned in regard to the boundary-marks, in the presence of an assembly of villagers and also of the two contending parties.—(254)
````
The opinion that, on being questioned, they unanimously declare in regard to the boundary,—according to that he shall lay down the boundary, recording also the names of them all.—(255)
````
Placing earth upon their heads, wearing garlands and red clothes, and being sworn by their respective meritorious deeds, they shall decide honestly.—(256)
````
If they decide in the right manner, they, being truthful witnesses, become purified; but if they decide contrariwise, they should be made to pay a fine of two hundred.—(257)
````
In the absence of witnesses four honest inhabitants of neighbouring villages shall make the determination of the boundary, in the presence of the king.—(258)
````
In the absence of such original inhabitants of neighbouring villages as could be witnesses in regard to the boundary, the king may examine these (following) frequenters of forests also.—(259)
````
Hunters, Fowlers, Cowherds, Fishermen, Root-diggers, Snake-catchers, Gleaners and other Foresters.—(260)
````
As they, on being questioned in fairness, declare the marks of boundary-lines between two villages, even so shall the king fix it.—(261)
````
In the case of fields, walls, tanks, gardens and houses, the decision regarding boundary-marks is dependent upon the neighbours.—(262)
````
In the case of men disputing about boundary-marks, if the neighbours depose falsely, all of them should be severally punished by the king with the ‘middle amercement.’—(268)
````
If a person, by intimidation, appropriates a house, a tank, a garden, or a field, he shall be fined five hundred; but only two hundred, if he does it in ignorance.—(264)
````
In the event of the boundary being unascertainable, the righteous king shall himself assign to them their lands, on the basis of advantages. Such is the established law.—(265)
````
Thus has the whole law relating to the demarcation of boundaries been propounded. After this I am going to expound that relating to verbal assault.—(266)
````
On abusing a Brāhmaṇa the Kṣatriya should be fined one hundred; and the Vaiśya one hundred and fifty; or two hundred; the Śūdra however deserves immolation.—(267)
````
For abusing a Kṣatriya, the Brāhmaṇa should be fined fifty; and in the case of a Vaiśya, the fine shall be twenty-five; and in that of a Shudra, twelve.—(268)
````
Among twice-born men, when there is offence against an equal, the fine is twelve only in the case of unutterable abuses, it shall be double.—(269)
````
If a once-born person insults a twice-born one with gross abuse, he should suffer the cutting off of his tongue; as he is of low origin.—(270)
````
If he mentions the name and caste of these men with scorn, a burning iron nail ten inches long shall be thrust into his mouth.—(271)
````
If through arrogance, he teaches brāhmaṇas their duty, the king shall pour heated oil into his mouth and ears.—(272)
````
He who, through arrogance, speaks falsely regarding the learning, the habitat, the caste, the occupation, or the bodily details (of another person), should be made to pay a pine of two hundred.—(273)
````
If a man, even truly, calls another ‘one-eyed’ or ‘lame’ or something else like it,—he should be made to pay a fine of at least one ‘Kārṣāpaṇa.’—(274)
````
He who alienates the mother, the father, the wife, the brother, the child or the preceptor, should be made to pay a hundred; as also one who does not give the way to his preceptor.—(276)
````
The discerning king shall inflict this punishment upon the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya: the brāhmaṇa shall be fined the lowest amercement and the kṣatriya the middlemost—(276)
````
On the Vaiśya and the Śūdra also, the inflicting of punishment shall be of the same kind, according to their respective castes,—barring mutilation; such is the decision.—(277)
````
Thus the law relating to punishments in connection with verbal assaults been truly expounded; after thisI am going to profound the law relating to physical assault.—(278)
````
With whatever limb the low-born man hurts a superior person, every such limb of his shall be cut off; this is the teaching of Manu.—(279)
````
If he raises his hand or a stick, he should have his hand cut off; if he strikes in anger with the foot, his foot shall be cut off.—(280)
````
If a low-born person tries to occupy the same seat with his superior, he should be branded on the hip and banished; or the king shall have his buttocks cut off.—(281)
````
If, out of arrogance, he spits, the king should have his two lips cut off; if he urinates, then his penis; and if he breaks wind, his anus.—(282)
````
If he catches hold of the hair, the king shall unhesitatingly have his hands out off; also if he lays hold of the feet, the beard, the neck, or the scrotum.—(283)
````
If he catches hold of the hair, the king shall unhesitatingly have his hands out off; also if he lays hold of the feet, the beard, the neck, or the scrotum.—(283)
````
One who bruises the skin should be fined one hundred; as also one who fetches blood; he who cuts the flesh, six ‘niṣkas’ and the bone-breaker should be banished.—(284)
````
In the case of all trees, as their usefulness so should be the punishment inflicted for injuring them; this is the settled rule.—(285)
````
When a hurt has been inflicted on men or animals, with the motive of causing pain, the king shall inflict punishment in proportion to the greatness of the pain caused.—(286)
````
In the case of injury to limbs, as also of strength and of blood,—the man should be made to pay the expenses of recovery, or the whole amount as ‘fine.’—(287)
````
When a man, either intentionally or unintentionally, damages the goods of another, he shall give satisfaction to him and pay to the king a fine equal to it.—(288)
````
In the case or leather and leathern vessels, and in that of those made of wood or clay, the fine shall be five times their value; as also in the case of flowers, roots and fruits.—(289)
````
In the case of the conveyance, its rider and its owner, they lay down ten exclusions; for the rest penalties are prescribed.—(290)
````
When there is snapping of the nose-string, when the yoke is broken, when it turns sideways or backwards, when the axle breaks, and when the wheel is broken; (291) when the fittings or the yoking strap or the bridle are torn, and when there has been the loud cry ‘get out of the way,’—there is no punishment; so has Manu declared—(292)
````
When however, on account of the driver’s ineptitude, the cart turns off and causes injury, the owner shall be punished with a fine of two hundred.—(293) If the driver is a trained one, it is he that should be punished; if the driver is untrained, all the occupants of the cart should be fined a hundred each.—(294) 
````
But if he happens to be stopped on the road and causes the death of a living being, either through animals or through the cart,—in such a case there is no doubt regarding punishment.—(295)
````
If the case of a man being killed, on the spot, the guilt would be similar to that of the thief; and half of that in the case of the larger animals, such as cows, elephants, camels, horses and the like.—(296)
````
In the case of hurting petty animals, the fine is two h undred; and fifty in the case of the auspicious quadrupeds and birds.—(297)
````
In the case of donkeys, goat and sheep the fine shall consist of five ‘māṣas’; and the fine shall be one ‘māṣa’ for the killing of a dog ok a pig.—(298)
````
The wife, the son, the slave, the servant and the uterine brother shall be beaten with a rope or a split bamboo, when they have committed a fault.—(299)
````
But only on the back part of the body, and never on the upper part; he who strikes otherwise than this incurs the guilt of a thief.—(300)
````
Thus has the law relating to physical assault been fully explained; after this I am going to expound the law for the regulating of punishments in cases of theft.—(301)
````
The King shall, make the best efforts for suppressing thieves; by the suppression of thieves comes fame and the kingdom prospers.—(302)
````
The King who imparts security is ever to be honoured; his sacrificial session constantly prospers, accompanied as it is by the gift of ‘security.’—(303)
````
To the King who protects (his people) accrues the sixth part of the spiritual merit of all persons; and the sixth of their demerit also accrues to him, if he protects them not—(301).
````
When one reads the Veda, when one performs a sacrifice, when one makes gifts, when one worships,—to the sixth part of each of those the king becomes entitled, in consequence of properly protecting the people—(305).
````
The king who, according to the law, protects all creatures and strikes them who deserve to be struck, offers, day by day, sacrifices at which hundreds of thousands are given away.—(306)
````
The king, who, without affording protection, takes tributes, taxes, duties, presents and fines, would immediately sink into hell.—(307)
````
He who affords no protection and devours the people, grabbing his tribute of the sixth part of the produce,—him they declare to be the imbiber of the filth of the whole people.—(308)
````
He who heeds not the bounds of morality, who is a disbeliever, who is extortionate, who does not afford protection, and is grabbing,—such a king one should regard as doomed to perdition.—(309)
````
He shall carefully suppress the unrighteous by three modes (of restraint)—by imprisonment, by enchaining and by various forms of ‘immolation.’—(310)
````
For by suppressing the vicious and postering the virtuous, kings become purified, just as twice-born men by the daily sacrifices.—(311)
````
The king should always forgive the partisans of litigants who abuse him, as also the young, the aged and the infirm,—thereby accomplishing his own welfare.—(312)
````
He who, on being abused by men in distress, forgives, becomes exalted to heaven, by that act; while he who, through kingly pride, does not forgive, goes, by that act, to hell.—(313)
````
The wise thief shall approach the king, with flying hair, confessing the theft, with the words—‘I have done this, punish me’;—(314)
````
—Carrying on his shoulder a pestle, or a Club of khadira wood, or a spear sharp at both ends, or an iron staff.—(315)
````
The thief becomes absolved from the theft, either through punishment or through acquittal. By not punishing the thief, the king imbibes the guilt of the thief.—(310)
````
The Embryo-killer expurgates his guilt on him who eats his food, the misbehaving wife on her husband, the disciple and the sacrificer on the preceptor, and the thief on the king.—(317)
````
Men who, having committed crimes, have been punished by Kings, become freed from guilt and go to heaven, just like well-behaved good men.—(318)
````
When one steals the rope or the water-pot from the well, or damages a water-drinking establishment, he should be punished with a fine of one ‘māṣa,’ and should restore the article to the place.—(319)
````
There shall be ‘immolation’ for one who steals more than ten jars of grain; in other cases he should he made to pay eleven times as much, as also make good the property to the owner.—(320)
````
In the case or articles weighed by scales,—gold, silver and the rest,—if more than a hundred (are stolen),
````
In the case of more than fifty, the cutting off of the hands is prescribed. In other cases, the king shall inflict a fine of eleven times the value.—(322)
````
For stealing noble men, and specially women, and the precious gems, the thief deserves ‘immolation.’—(323)
````
For the stealing of large animals, of weapons or medicines, the king shall determine the punishment, after considering the time and the purpose.—(324)
````
For stealing cows belonging to a Brāhmaṇa, and for piercing them with the goad, and for stealing animals, the thief should be immediately made half-footed.—(325)
````
In the case of the theft of yarns, cotton, fermenting drug, cowdung, molasses, curds, milk, skimmed curd, water and grass (326),—of vessels made of bamboo or cane, as also of salts, earthenware, earth and ashes (327)—of fish, birds, oil, clarified butter, meat, honey, and other animal-products (328)—of other things of this kind, spirituous liquors, cooked rice and all kinds of cooked food,—the fine shall be double the value of the thing (stolen).—(326-329)
````
For flowers, green corns, shrubs, creepers, trees and other unhusked (grains), the fine shall consist of five ‘kṛṣṇalas.’—(330)
````
For husked grains, for vegetables, roots and fruits, there shall be a fine of a hundred, in a case where there has been no propitiation; and fifty, where there has been propitiation.—(331)
````If the act is committed with violence and in the presence of men, it is ‘robbery’; it is ‘theft’ when done in the absence of men, and when it is denied after having been done.—(332)
````
If a man steals these things when they have been prepared, the king should fine him one hundred; as also him who steals the fire from the house.—(333) 
````
By whatever limb the thief operates against men, that shall the king take off, by way of retribution.—(334)
````
Neither the father or the preceptor or the friend or the mother or the wife or the son or the priest is unpunishable for the King, when they do not keep within their duty.—(335)
````
When an ordinary man would be fined one ‘Kārṣāpaṇa,’ the king should be fined one thousand; such is the established rule.—(336)
````
In the case of theft, the guilt of a Śūdra is eightfold, that of the Vaiśya sixteen-fold, and that of the Kṣatriya thirty-two-fold;—(337) that of the Brāhmaṇa sixty-four-fold, or fully hundred-fold, or twice sixty-four-fold; when he is cognisant of the good or bad quality of the act.—(338) 
````
Fuel for fire and trees, roots and fruits, and grass, for feeding cows,—the taking of these Manu has declared to be no theft.—(339)
````
If a Brāhmaṇa seeks, even by sacrificing and teaching, to obtain wealth from one who has taken what has not been given to him,—he is just like a thief.—(340)
````
If a twice-born person, running short of provisions while on a journey, takes two sugar-cane stalks, or two roots, from another man’s field, he does not deserve to be made to pay a fine.—(341)
````
One who enchains the unchained, or sets free the enchained, as also one who takes away a slave, a horse or a chariot, incurs the guilt of the thief.—(342)
````
By punishing thieves in accordance with th is law, the king obtains fame in this world, and after death, unsurpassable bliss.—(343)
````
The king who is desirous of indra’s eternal place, as also of imperishable fame, shall not ignore the desperado even for a moment.—(344)
````
He who commits violence is to be regarded as the worst offender, as compared to one who is wicked of speech, to a thief and to one who hurts with a staff.—(310)
````
The king who condones the perpetrator of violence quickly falls into destruction and incurs hatred.—(346)
````
Neither for the sake of friendship, nor for the sake of a large gain of money, should the king let off the perpetrators of violence, who cause terror to all living beings.—(347)
````
Twice-born persons shall carry arms: When religion is interfered with, when there is confusion among the twice-born castes caused by the exigencies of time,—(348) in his own defence, in cases of hindrance of sacrificial fees, in the case of outrages upon Brāhmaṇas and women,—if one strikes in the cause of right, he incurs no sin.—(319)
````
Without hesitation one should strike an approaching desperado,—be he a preceptor, a child, or an aged man, or a highly learned Brāhmaṇa.—(350)
````
No evil of any kind accrues to the slayer for killing a desperado, either openly or secretly; as it is only Fury recoiling upon Fury.—(361)
````
Those men who are addicted to intercourse with the wives of other men, the king shall banish after having branded them with terror-inspiring punishments.—(352)
````
For out of that arises the admixture of castes among people;—whence follows root-rending unrighteousness, tending to total destruction.—(353)
````
A man who engages in secret conversation with the wife of another person,—if he is one who has been previously accused of similar offences,—should receive the penalty of the ‘first amercement.’—(354)
````
If, however, he is one who has not been previously accused, and converses with her for some good reason, he does not incur any guilt; as in his case there has been no transgression.—(355)
````
He who converses with ‘another’s woman’ at a watering place, or in a wilderness, or in a forest, or at the confluence of rivers,—incurs the guilt of ‘adultery.’—(356)
````
Offering help, flirting, touching of ornaments and clothes, sitting on the same bed,—all this has been declared to be ‘adultery.’—(357)
````
If one touches a woman in an improper place, or condones it when touched by her,—all this, when done with mutual consent, has been declared to be ‘adultery’—(358)
````
In a case of adultery, a non-Brāhmaṇa deserves the penalty ending in death; as the wives of all the four castes are always the most deserving of protection.—(359)
````
Mendicants, bards, persons initiated for a rite and craftsmen may converse with women, unchecked.—(360)
````
One should not converse with the wives of other men, when forbidden. If, on being forbidden, he does converse, he becomes liable to be fined one ‘suvarṇa.’—(361)
````
This rule does not apply to the case of the wives of dancers and singers, or of those who make a living of themselves; for these men secretly bring their women into contact (with other men), and tempt them on.—(362)
````
Yet he who secretly carries on conversation with these women, or with maidservants devoted to one master, or with female ascetics, should be made to pay something.—(363)
````
If a man of equal status violates an unwilling maiden, he deserves immediate death; but if he violates a willing one, he shall not suffer death.—(364)
````
If a maiden approaches a superior person, she shall not be made to pay anything; if however she courts an inferior person, she shall be kept confined in the house.—(365)
````
An inferior man courting a superior maiden deserves death; he who courts a maiden of equal status, shall pay the nuptial fee, if her father so wishes.—(366).
````
But if any man wantonly defiles a maiden through sheer audacity, his fingers should be instantly clipped off, or he should be fined six hundred.—(367)
````
A man of equal status defiling a willing maiden shall not suffer amputation of fingers; he should be made to pay the fine of two hundred with a view to prevent repetition.—(368)
````
If a maiden pollutes another maiden, her fine shall be two hundred; she shall also pay the double of her nuptial fee and shall receive ten lashes.—(369)
````
But if a woman pollutes a maiden, she deserves immediate shaving off, or the amputation of two fingers, and also being carried by a donkey.—(370)
````
If a woman, proud of relations and her qualities, passes over her husband, the king shall have her devoured by dogs in a place frequented by many.—(371)
````
The offending male he should make to lie down upon a redhot iron bed; they shall put wooden-logs over him, so that the sinner may be burnt.—(372)
````
If the convicted man is accused again within a year, he shall be punished with a double fine. the same also in the case of intercourse with a ‘vrātyā’ or a ‘chāṇḍālī.’—(373)
````
A śūdra having intercourse with a twice-born woman, protected or unprotected, shall be deprived of his limb and his whole property, in the case of the unprotected woman, and of everything in that of the protected.—(374).
````
The Vaiśya should be fined his entire property after a year’s imprisonment; the Kṣatriya is to be fined one thousand, and be shaved with urine.—(375)
````
If the Vaiśya and the Kṣatriya have intercourse with an unprotected Brāhmaṇa woman, the Vaiśya should be committed with five hundred and the Kṣatriya with one thousand.—(376)
````
But both these, when offending against a protected Brāhmaṇa woman, should be punished like a Śūdra, or burnt in a fire of dry grass.—(377)
````
The Brāhmaṇa who has intercourse with a protected Brāhmaṇa woman by force should be fined one thousand; he who has connection with a willing one, should be fined five hundred.—(378)
````
Tonsure has been prescribed as the death-penalty for the Brāhmaṇa; for other castes the penalty would be actual death.—(379)
````
Verily he shall not kill the Brāhmaṇa, even though he be steeped in all crimes; he should banish him from the kingdom, with all his property and unhurt.—(380).
````
There is no greater crime on earth than the slaying of a Brāhmaṇa; the king shall, therefore, not even think of his death in his mind.—(381)
````
If a Vaiśya approaches a protected Kṣatriya woman, or the Kṣatriya a Vaiśya woman,—both these deserve the same punishment as that in the case of an unprotected Brāhmaṇa woman.—(382)
````
The Brāhmaṇa having intercourse with the said two, when protected, should be made to pay a fine of one thousand; the fine for the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya approaching a Śūdra woman, should be one thousand.—(383)
````
In the case of the Vaiśya approaching an unprotected Kṣatriya woman, the fine shall be five hundred; but the Kṣatriya may suffer tonsure or the fine.—(384)
````
The Brāhmaṇa, approaching an unprotected Vaiśya or Kṣatriya woman, should be fined five hundred, and one thousand for approaching a woman of the lowest order.—(385)
````
That king in whose town there is no thief, no adulterer, no defamer, no criminal, no assaulter,—attains the regions of Indra.—(386)
````
The suppression of these five in his own dominions secures to the king paramount sovereignty among his peers and fame in the world.—(387)
````
If a sacrificer forsakes an officiating priest, and if an officiating priest forsakes a sacrificer,—each being capable of doing the work and free from disqualifications,—their punishment is one hundred each—(388).
````
Neither the mother, nor the father, nor the wife, nor the son deserve to be forsaken; he who forsakes these, unless they are outcasts, should be fined six hundred by the king.—(389)
````
For twice-born men disputing among themselves regarding any point relating to the orders, the king, desirous of his own welfare, shall not determine the law.—(390)
````
Having, with the assistance of Brāhmaṇas, received them with due honour, the king shall, at first, pacify them with soothing words, and then explain to them their duty.—(391)
````
If, at a festival where twenty twice-born men are invited, a Brāhmaṇa does not entertain his frontal and back neighbours, who are quite worthy,—he deserves to be fined one ‘māṣa.’—(392)
````
The Vedic scholar who does not entertain a worthy Vedic scholar at such auspicious rites, should be made to pay twice the quantity of that meal, and also a ‘māṣa’ of gold.—(393)
````
A blind man, an idiot, a cripple, an old man of seventy, and one who attends upon Vedic scholars should not be made to pay any taxes by any one.—(394)
````The king should always respect the Vedic scholar, the sick and the distressed, the infant and the aged, the indigent, the man of high family and the gentleman.—(395)
````
The washerman shall wash (clothes) gently on a smooth board of cotton-tree wood; he shall not carry clothes in other clothes; nor shall he allow them to be worn.—(396)
````
The weaver shall repay ten ‘palas’ with one ‘pala’ added to it; if he acts otherwise than this, he should be made to pay a fine of twelve.—(397)
````
The king shall take one-twentieth of the price of saleable commodities, that may be fixed by men who have experience of custom-houses and are experts in all kinds of merchandise.—(398)
````
Those commodities that have been proclaimed as the ‘king’s monopoly,’ and those that are forbidden,—if any one, through greed, exports these, the king shall confiscate all his property.—(399)
````
If one who buts and sells avoids a custom-house, and at the improper time, or makes a wrong statement in counting,—he shall be made to pay a fine eight times the amount evaded.—(400)
````
The king shall regulate the purchase and sale of all marketable commodities after having taken into consideration their source, destination and detention, as also profit and loss.—(401)
````
After the lapse of every five days, or after that of every fortnight, the king shall publicly fix the prices of things.—(402)
````
Scales, weights and measures should be duly marked; and they should be re-examined after every six months.—(403)
````
At a ferry-crossing, a cart shall be made to pay one ‘paṇa’; one man’s burden half a ‘paṇa,’ an animal and a woman a quarter ‘paṇa,’ and an unloaded man one half of a quarter.—(404)
````
Carts laden with commodities should be made to pay the ferry-toll according to their value; those not laden with commodities may pay a triple, as also men without luggage.—(405)
````
For a long passage, the boat-fare should be in propor tion to the time and place; this should be understood to be the rule regarding the banks of rivers; in connection with the sea, there is no fixed rule.—(406)
````
But a woman who is pregnant two months or more, an ascetic, a hermit, and brāhmaṇas in holy orders shall not be made to pay the toll at a ferry-crossing.—(407)
````
If anything on the boat happen to be damaged by the fault of the boatmen,—it shall be made good by the boatmen collectively, each according to his share.—(408)
````
This law has been laid down in connection with suits by boat-passengers relating to the negligence of boatmen in water; there is no punishment in the case of accidents due to heaven.—(409)
````
He shall make the Vaiśya to carry on trade, money-lending, agriculture,—and cattle-trading; and the Śūdra to perform service for the twice-born castes.—(410)
````
A Brāhmaṇa shall, through compassion, support a Vaiśya and a Kṣatriya, who are distressed for a livelihood, and should make them do his own work.—(411)
````
If the Brāhmaṇa, through the sense of mastery, and out of greed, makes sanctified twice-born persons do fertile work, against their will,—he should be fined by the king six hundred.—(412)
````
But a Śūdra, whether bought or unbought, he shall make to do servile work; since it is for doing servile work for the Brāhmaṇa that he has been created by the self-born one.—(413)
````
Even though set free by the master, the Śūdra is not released from service; since that is innate in him, and who can release him from it?—(414)
````
There are seven kinds of slaves—(1) captured under a banner, (2) slave on food, (3) born in the house, (4) bought, (5) presented, (6) hereditary, and (7) slave by punishment.—(415)
````
The wive, the son and the slave,—these three are declared to have no property; whatever they acquire is the property of him to whom they belong.—(416)
````
The Brāhmaṇa may confidently have recourse to seizing the goods of the Śūdra; as the latter has no property, and his property is meant to be seized by the master.—(417)
````
The king shall make the Vaiśya and the Shudra carefully to perform their duties; for by swerving from their duties they would disturb this world.—(418)
````
Day after day he shall look after his business-centres, his conveyances, his income and expenditure regularly, and mines and treasury.—(419)
````
The king who completes all this business, removes all sin and attains the highest state.—(420)
